# QuickStash

A mod that uses _Compulsively Count_ on all nearby stashes with 1 click.  
Default key is G.

Note this is both a client and server mod.

### Installation

Required

- Install [BepInEx](https://v-rising.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_V_Rising/)
- Install [Wetstone](https://v-rising.thunderstore.io/package/molenzwiebel/Wetstone/)
- Extract _quick_stash.dll_ into _(VRising folder)/BepInEx/plugins_
- Extract _quick_stash.dll_ into _(VRising folder)/VRising_Server/BepInEx/plugins_

Optional

- for singleplayer, install [ServerLaunchFix](https://v-rising.thunderstore.io/package/Mythic/ServerLaunchFix/) to fix issues with the server mod not working

### Configuration

The keybindings are changed in the menu in-game.

For server configuration, after running the game once, the config file will be generated.

- Update server config in _(VRising folder)/VRising_Server/BepInEx/config/quick_stash.cfg_

### Troubleshooting

- If the mod doesn't work, it is probably because the server part is not installed, check your BepInEx logs on both the client and server to make sure you are running the latest version of both QuickStash and Wetstone.
